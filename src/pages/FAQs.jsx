          question: "What is FastPay LLC?",
          answer: "FastPay LLC is a licensed Money Services Business (MSB) that provides secure, fast, and reliable cross-border payment solutions between the United States and Ethiopia. We are fully licensed by Maryland's Office of Financial Regulation, registered with NMLS (ID: 2327896) and FinCEN, and approved by the National Bank of Ethiopia."
        },
        {
          question: "How do I create an account?",
          answer: "Creating an account is simple. Click on 'Login' in the header, then select 'Sign Up'. You'll need to provide your personal information, verify your identity (KYC requirements), and set up your payment methods. The entire process typically takes 5-10 minutes."
        },
        {
          question: "What documents do I need to register?",
          answer: "For KYC compliance, you'll need a valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, or state ID), proof of address (utility bill or bank statement), and your Social Security Number or Tax ID. This is required by federal regulations including the Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act."

      category: "Sending Money",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How long does a transfer take?",
          answer: "Most transfers are completed within minutes. Once you submit a transaction, it's processed in real-time and funds are typically available to the recipient immediately. In rare cases, transfers may take up to 1 business day due to bank processing times."
        },
        {
          question: "What are your fees and exchange rates?",
          answer: "FastPay offers transparent, competitive pricing. Exchange rates are updated in real-time and displayed before you confirm your transaction. There are no hidden fees â€“ what you see is what you pay."
        },
        {
          question: "How much can I send?",
          answer: "Transfer limits depend on your account verification level and transaction history. New accounts typically start with a daily limit of $3,000 and can be increased upon request with additional verification."
        },
        {
          question: "Which banks in Ethiopia can receive transfers?",
          answer: "FastPay instantly deposit with more than 30 leading banks across Ethiopia, including Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Awash Bank, Dashen Bank, Bank of Abyssinia, and many others. This ensures broad coverage and accessibility for your recipients."

      questions: [
        {
          question: "Is FastPay secure?",
          answer: "Yes, security is our top priority. We use bank-level security including end-to-end encryption, SSL connections, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access controls. All transactions are monitored for fraud, and we comply with BSA, USA PATRIOT Act, and OFAC regulations."
        },
        {
          question: "How is my personal information protected?",
          answer: "Your data is protected through multiple layers of security. We use industry-standard encryption for data transmission and storage, maintain strict access controls, and never share your information with third parties except as required by law or to complete your transactions."
        },
        {
          question: "What is KYC and why is it required?",
          answer: "KYC (Know Your Customer) is a regulatory requirement under the Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act. It helps prevent money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing. As a licensed MSB, we are legally required to verify the identity of all customers."
        },
        {
          question: "Are my transactions monitored?",
          answer: "Yes, as required by federal law, all transactions are monitored for suspicious activity using automated systems and manual reviews. This includes velocity checks, pattern analysis, and screening against OFAC watchlists. This protects both you and the integrity of the financial system."
